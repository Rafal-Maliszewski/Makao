This is a simplified version of popular card game "makao" made for a coding training purpose.

This game does not contains all the original rules.
The game is conducted with a one BOT making random moves, however there can be easily added other players/BOTs by adding a line of a code.
UI is made of text messages in console.

There can be many ideas how to further develop program, like:
-  changing UI for a graphical
-  implementing all rules
-  enchancing BOT quality
-  making 2+ players game possible without cheating
